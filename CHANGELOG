=======================
.trp file format change
=======================

Old format:

  2 bytes: Magic value (0x1337)
  2 bytes: Tibia version
  4 bytes: Recording length in milliseconds
  4 bytes: Number of recording packets (n)
  n recording packets:
    4 bytes: Recording packet time in milliseconds
    2 bytes: Length of packet (m)
    m bytes: Packet data (including the 2 byte Tibia packet length)

The format was changed since, if the recording has been "corrected" then the
length of a packet (m) is always equal to the Tibia packet length minus 2.
This means that we waste 2 bytes per recording packet, and also makes playback
of version >7.7 more complex to implement due to XTEA encryption.

New format:

  4 bytes: Magic value ('T', 'R', 'P', '\0')
  2 bytes: Tibia version
  4 bytes: Recording length in milliseconds
  4 bytes: Number of frames (n)
  n frames:
    4 bytes: Frame time in milliseconds
    2 bytes: Length of frame data (m)
    m bytes: Frame data (without the 2 byte Tibia packet length)

Note that this require the recording to be "corrected", which now will happen
automatically when a .rec file is loaded.

Also note that the name "Recording packet" has changed to "Frame", to avoid
confusion between a recording packet and a Tibia packet.

As this is an internal tool, no backwards compatibility is implemented.
