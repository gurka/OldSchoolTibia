- Verify that all usage of force=True is: as long as one frame has been parsed, return the Recording, otherwise throw an exception
- Verify that no specific parsers throw exception with filename in the message (each tool, dump.py, etc, can/will add that)
- Make force=True default, change --force to --no-force
- Rename parameter force to allow_partial
